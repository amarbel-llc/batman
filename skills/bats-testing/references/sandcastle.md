# Sandcastle Environment Isolation Reference

## Overview

Sandcastle wraps Anthropic's experimental `sandbox-runtime` project, providing filesystem and network isolation for command execution. It uses bubblewrap (bwrap) under the hood to create lightweight sandboxes without requiring root privileges.

**Source:** `github:amarbel-llc/sandcastle`

## CLI Interface

```
sandcastle [options] [command...]

Options:
  -d, --debug              Enable debug logging
  --config <path>          Path to config file (default: ~/.srt-settings.json)
  --shell <shell>          Shell to execute the command with
  --control-fd <fd>        Read config updates from file descriptor (JSON lines)
```

### Common Usage

```bash
# Run a command in sandbox with custom config
sandcastle --shell bash --config /path/to/config.json bats --tap tests.bats

# Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
sandcastle --debug --config /path/to/config.json my-command

# Pass through arguments
sandcastle --shell bash --config "$config" "$@"
```

## Configuration Format

The configuration is a JSON file with two top-level sections:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "denyRead": [],
    "denyWrite": [],
    "allowWrite": []
  },
  "network": {
    "allowedDomains": [],
    "deniedDomains": []
  }
}
```

### Filesystem Section

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `denyRead` | `string[]` | Paths blocked from reading |
| `denyWrite` | `string[]` | Paths blocked from writing |
| `allowWrite` | `string[]` | Paths explicitly allowed for writing |

### Network Section

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `allowedDomains` | `string[]` | Domains that may be accessed (allowlist) |
| `deniedDomains` | `string[]` | Domains that are blocked (denylist) |

## Batman Bats Wrapper

Batman's `bats` wrapper automatically invokes sandcastle. Every `bats` invocation is sandboxed with:

- **Read denied:** `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config`, `~/.local`, `~/.password-store`, `~/.kube`
- **Write allowed:** `/tmp` only
- **Network:** unrestricted

No wrapper script or manual sandcastle configuration is needed. Just run `bats` normally.

To skip sandcastle (e.g., for debugging sandbox issues), pass `--no-sandbox`:

```bash
bats --no-sandbox my_test.bats
```

For custom sandcastle policies beyond the defaults (e.g., network restrictions, additional deny paths), use `--no-sandbox` and invoke sandcastle directly — see the CLI interface section above.

## Network-Restricted Policies

For tests that should not make network calls:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "denyRead": ["$HOME/.ssh", "$HOME/.aws", "$HOME/.gnupg"],
    "denyWrite": [],
    "allowWrite": ["/tmp"]
  },
  "network": {
    "allowedDomains": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"],
    "deniedDomains": []
  }
}
```

For tests that need specific external services:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "allowedDomains": ["api.example.com", "localhost"],
    "deniedDomains": []
  }
}
```

## Nix Integration

Add sandcastle to a flake:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    sandcastle.url = "github:amarbel-llc/sandcastle";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, sandcastle, ... }:
    # In devShell packages:
    sandcastle.packages.${system}.default
}
```

Sandcastle pulls in its own dependencies (bubblewrap, socat, ripgrep) via Nix.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail with permission denied
- Check that `allowWrite` includes `/tmp`
- Verify `$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR` is under `/tmp`
- Use `--debug` flag on sandcastle to see which paths are being denied

### Tests can't find binaries
- Ensure the binary path is not under a denied read directory
- The `$PATH` must be accessible from within the sandbox
- Nix store paths (`/nix/store/...`) are readable by default

### Slow test startup
- Sandcastle has minimal overhead per invocation
- Run it once wrapping the entire `bats` command, not per-test
- The wrapper should call `bats` as a single sandcastle invocation
